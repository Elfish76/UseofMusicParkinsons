The teacher also delivers a commercial course, branded 'Silver Swans', which I take part in - I sit out when my legs start to complain.

The playlist included The Wirzerls version of Golden Brown (you need a pause every few steps). ","Yes, I have a song that is like a personal anthem for me.","I have more than one! In the last few years, Forever in Blue Jeans (Neil Diamond) has been quite a relevant song. The B52s Love Shack is always a bit of a mood lifter, maybe because it's a wedding disco song. And Oops Upside Your Head - that's got a difficult rhythm. My relationship with songs has changed at different stages throughout my life.

So it's really good for Parkinson's , but it's also a distraction form other things. But I do feel very strongly that it tricks my brain out of producing these weird symptoms. I put music on deliberatley to try to reset myself - the same ones I've already said are useful for this. Like 9 to 5 by Dolly Parton, a lot come from the dance class - so if I'm at home and I want to distract myself, then Ji Ho - you know the ones that become engrained from the dance class.

","But sometimes I forget! Most effective when I can actually use the music rather than imagine the music-I think what happens is that it starts to move my body bit by bit. But I can do it when I can't actually access the music, I can imagine it; I guess I sing like the emphasis of the rhythm. This is where being stuck inside for a year is telling! I think Shotgun is the song I had got to - the rhythm is really important in that one because it does do 1.2.1.2. like your feet have got too and it's all two syllable words or phrases and it replicates the rhythm that you need topics you feet up and walk.

","Also when you've had a stressful time, instead of just screaming in anger you can sing and it gets that frustration and feeling of helplessness away. because it's so deep, it gets hold of you and you can let it all out - like in Le Miserable - it's stirring.

Like the John Dunbar theme - a film about a soldier - oh, Dances with Wolves, oh and Out of Africa, they are just so wonderful.You know, I'm there! Going up the mouton on horseback, going into the snow - it paints a picture you know.

The type of music is important as well. When I am walking I try to keep a fast pace for cardio reasons, so I found that classical music doesn't really do it. Pop music does quite well, things that I probably wouldn't listen to. Also, rock and heavy metal, and again, that's not something that I would usually listen to these days. YOu can listen to all the things that you used to listen to when you were 14. If it's got an insistent beat and up tempo then it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Any sort of music is better than no music. My walking becomes asymmetrical, my right arm doesn't move and I feel stiff. But you seem to forgt about it when you listen to music. You feel natural when you are walking. Before lockdown I was part of an exercise group, and the lady who ran the course always used music for the class. The tracks that she chose were all of a certain era, but all had an insistent beat.","Listening to music for its own sake, to help me to relax. Whenever I'm driving I put music on, but then I have always done that. I'm listening to music now more than I watch TV. Whether its a concentration thing or not I don't know. Especially when there's only me watching it, I think, well, it's probably easier to listen to music. Also, music is a collaborative thing. I've got a couple of friends and we create a playlist. You post a track and then someone else posts one with a link, it can be as tenuous as you like, and then someone else posts one. You can do this if your Spotify list is public. Each track has to have a link with the previous one.",About half the time,"Music helps me walk faster,Music helps me control my steps,Music helps me to synchronize my steps, or movements to the beat,Other (please describe in text box)",Heavy metal or rock,Heavy metal or rock or pop (music with a beat).

Quite often you can ignore what the song's about and take in the noises. An example is the Cocteau Twins, Liz Fraser. She sings words, but a lot is lost in the way she bends the words, she's got a very distinctive voice. E.g. her track 'fru fru foxes in midsummer fires'. On one of her albums that track listings are just girls names. 'Ethereal' is the way that I would describe her voice. Also Tim Buckley 'Song for the Sirens', she did a cover version of it, part of a collective called 'This Mortal Coil'.","I listen to standards, I'll whack some Tom Jones on, something like that, something uplifting with a beat.","The range is becoming narrower and narrower as my voice changes.
