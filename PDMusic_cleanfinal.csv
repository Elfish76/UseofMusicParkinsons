The teacher also delivers a commercial course, branded 'Silver Swans', which I take part in - I sit out when my legs start to complain.

I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one'll love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I am brave, I am bruised

I think Shotgun is the song I had got to - the rhythm is really important in that one because it does do 1.2.1.2. like your feet have got too and it's all two syllable words or phrases and it replicates the rhythm that you need topics you feet up and walk.

The type of music is important as well. When I am walking I try to keep a fast pace for cardio reasons, so I found that classical music doesn't really do it. Pop music does quite well, things that I probably wouldn't listen to. Also, rock and heavy metal, and again, that's not something that I would usually listen to these days. YOu can listen to all the things that you used to listen to when you were 14. If it's got an insistent beat and up tempo then it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Any sort of music is better than no music. My walking becomes asymmetrical, my right arm doesn't move and I feel stiff. But you seem to forgt about it when you listen to music. You feel natural when you are walking. Before lockdown I was part of an exercise group, and the lady who ran the course always used music for the class. The tracks that she chose were all of a certain era, but all had an insistent beat.","Listening to music for its own sake, to help me to relax. Whenever I'm driving I put music on, but then I have always done that. I'm listening to music now more than I watch TV. Whether its a concentration thing or not I don't know. Especially when there's only me watching it, I think, well, it's probably easier to listen to music. Also, music is a collaborative thing. I've got a couple of friends and we create a playlist. You post a track and then someone else posts one with a link, it can be as tenuous as you like, and then someone else posts one. You can do this if your Spotify list is public. Each track has to have a link with the previous one.",1,"Music helps me walk faster,Music helps me control my steps,Music helps me to synchronize my steps, or movements to the beat,Other (please describe in text box)","Heavy metal or rock","Heavy metal or rock or pop (music with a beat).

Quite often you can ignore what the song's about and take in the noises. An example is the Cocteau Twins, Liz Fraser. She sings words, but a lot is lost in the way she bends the words, she's got a very distinctive voice. E.g. her track 'fru fru foxes in midsummer fires'. On one of her albums that track listings are just girls names. 'Ethereal' is the way that I would describe her voice. Also Tim Buckley 'Song for the Sirens', she did a cover version of it, part of a collective called 'This Mortal Coil'.","I listen to standards, I'll whack some Tom Jones on, something like that, something uplifting with a beat.","The range is becoming narrower and narrower as my voice changes.
